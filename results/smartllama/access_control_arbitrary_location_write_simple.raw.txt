=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

Return ONLY the JSON object described in the system message.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract does not use call.value() or delegatecall(), which are common sources of vulnerabilities. There are no time constraints in critical operations that could be exploited. The use of require statements ensures that operations do not exceed the bounds of arrays, preventing underflow or overflow issues. Access control is implemented correctly, restricting the Destroy() function to the owner only. There are no external calls that could lead to reentrancy attacks. Therefore, the code is secure against the target vulnerabilities.
