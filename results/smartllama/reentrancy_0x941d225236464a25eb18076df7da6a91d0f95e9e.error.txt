0. The contract uses call.value() in the CashOut function, which is a known source of reentrancy vulnerabilities. Specifically, line 44 contains the vulnerable code: 'if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())'. This external call happens before the balance is updated, allowing for a reentrant attack where an attacker can withdraw funds repeatedly by calling CashOut again before the balance is deducted. This issue is related to the order of operations and access control, as the contract does not properly manage the sequence of state changes and external calls.
