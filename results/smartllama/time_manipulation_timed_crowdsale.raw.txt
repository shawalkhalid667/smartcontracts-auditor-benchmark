=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses block.timestamp in a critical operation, specifically in the isSaleFinished() function where it checks if the current time is greater than or equal to 1546300800 (January 1, 2019). This reliance on block.timestamp makes the contract vulnerable to time manipulation by miners who can adjust the timestamp within certain limits. The precision of block.timestamp is at the second level which can be exploited by miners to prematurely trigger the sale finish condition or delay it. This vulnerability is related to all four focus points: use of block.timestamp, time constraints in critical operations, potential for miner manipulation, and precision of time measurements impacting contract logic.
