0. The contract uses delegatecall in the forward function which can potentially lead to access control issues if the callee contract is malicious. However, since the owner is set to the msg.sender during construction and there is no evidence of any other functions that could alter this ownership, assuming the owner is trustworthy and careful when using the forward function, this contract might be considered secure against access control attacks. The lack of additional functions that could modify the owner or other access controls makes it relatively safe in this aspect.
