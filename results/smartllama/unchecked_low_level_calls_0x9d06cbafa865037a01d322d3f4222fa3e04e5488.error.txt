0. The contract uses call.value() in the tokens_buy() function at line 22, which is a potential area for reentrancy attacks. Specifically, the external call to owner2.send(sum2) occurs before updating the contract's state regarding the transaction. This order of operations allows for a malicious contract to call back into the contract during the execution of tokens_buy(), potentially draining the contract of funds. Additionally, the withdraw() function at line 28 also uses owner.send(balance), which is another instance where funds are sent out before updating the contract's state, making it susceptible to reentrancy attacks. Access control is implemented through the onlyOwner modifier, but it does not prevent reentrancy attacks from occurring during the execution of functions that are not restricted to the owner.
