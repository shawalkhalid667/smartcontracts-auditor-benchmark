0. The contract does not use call.value(), thus avoiding one potential vector for reentrancy attacks. The withdrawAll function uses the transfer method, which is safer than call.value(). Access control is implemented through the require statement checking if the originator is the owner, preventing unauthorized access. There are no unchecked low-level calls, time manipulations, bad randomness, denial of service, front-running, short addresses, or arithmetic issues identified. The code is secure against the target vulnerabilities.
