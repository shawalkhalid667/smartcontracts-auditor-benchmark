=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses block.timestamp (now) in the lockTime mapping which can be manipulated by miners. This is a time manipulation vulnerability. Specifically, in the withdraw function, the requirement 'now > lockTime[msg.sender]' can be exploited by miners who have control over the timestamp of the blocks they mine. This can lead to premature unlocking of funds or extension of the lock period. The precision of time measurements used in the contract logic can also lead to vulnerabilities if the miner manipulates the timestamp to fall just before or after the lock period, affecting the arithmetic operations related to time.
