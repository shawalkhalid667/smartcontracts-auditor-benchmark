0. The contract uses call.value() in an insecure manner, which is a known attack vector for reentrancy attacks. Specifically, in the withdrawBalance() function, the external call to msg.sender.call.value(amountToWithdraw)("") is made before resetting the user's balance. This order of operations allows for a malicious contract to call withdrawBalance() again before the balance is set to zero, leading to reentrancy. The lack of proper access control or checks before making the external call exacerbates this issue. The target value is 1, indicating that this is a critical vulnerability that should be addressed immediately to prevent potential exploitation.
