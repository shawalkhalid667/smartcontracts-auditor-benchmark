0. The contract uses send() which is equivalent to call.value(). This can potentially lead to denial of service attacks if one of the recipients is malicious and reverts the transaction after receiving funds. The refundAll() function performs multiple external calls without proper ordering or checks in between, allowing for potential reentrancy attacks where a malicious contract could call back into the refundAll() function before all refunds are processed. Access control is not implemented, allowing anyone to call refundAll(). The internal function implementation does not include safeguards against reentrancy or checks for failed transactions.
