0. The contract does not use any low-level calls that could lead to vulnerabilities. There is no use of call.value() or any other form of Ether transfer that could be exploited. The order of operations does not place external calls before state changes, eliminating potential reentrancy attacks. There are no time constraints in critical operations that could be manipulated by miners. The access control mechanism is present through the onlyowner modifier, preventing unauthorized access to functions like changeOwner(). The internal function implementation does not introduce any additional risks as there are no unprotected internal functions that interact with external contracts. Therefore, the code is secure against all the target vulnerabilities.
