0. The contract uses call.value() in several instances which can lead to vulnerabilities if not properly controlled. Specifically, in the functions'request', 'deliver', and 'cancel', call.value() is used to send ether to the requester, SGX_ADDRESS, and the callbackAddr respectively. These external calls are made without ensuring that the contract's state is updated before the call, allowing for potential reentrancy attacks where an attacker could call back into the contract during the execution of one of these functions. Additionally, the access control mechanisms do not prevent unauthorized external calls effectively, as seen in the'request' function where externalCallFlag is set to true before checking the validity of the request, enabling an attacker to potentially manipulate the contract's state during this vulnerable period. The internal function implementation also contributes to the vulnerability by not properly ordering state changes before external calls, as seen in the 'deliver' function where the fee is sent to SGX_ADDRESS before updating the request status.
