0. The contract uses low-level calls such as.send() in several instances, specifically in the claimThrone() function at lines 110, 118, and 132, which can potentially lead to vulnerabilities if the recipient contract is malicious. These calls are made without checking the balance or state changes before sending Ether, allowing for possible reentrancy attacks where the recipient contract can call back into the contract and manipulate its state. Additionally, the sweepCommission() function at line 174 also uses.send(), which is not protected against reentrancy as it does not check the balance or state changes before sending Ether. Access control is implemented through the modifier onlywizard(), but it does not prevent reentrancy attacks since the checks are not performed before making external calls. The arithmetic operations in the contract are straightforward and do not introduce vulnerabilities related to arithmetic overflows or underflows. Overall, the contract has several points where it interacts with external contracts using low-level calls, which can potentially lead to reentrancy attacks if not properly safeguarded.
