0. The contract contains a reentrancy vulnerability in the CashOut function. Specifically, line with 'if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())' executes an external call before updating the balance ('balances[msg.sender]-=_am'). This order allows a malicious contract to call back into the CashOut function during the external call, potentially draining the contract of funds. This issue is related to access control as it allows any caller to trigger this behavior. The internal function implementation exacerbates the problem by not using safer patterns like the checks-effects-interactions approach.
