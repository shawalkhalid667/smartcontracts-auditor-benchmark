=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract does not use SafeMath or Solidity 0.8.x built-in overflow checks, which is a concern for arithmetic operations. Specifically, in the 'buy' function, the multiplication 'numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN' could result in an overflow if 'numTokens' is sufficiently large. Similarly, in the'sell' function, the subtraction 'balanceOf[msg.sender] -= numTokens' could result in an underflow if 'numTokens' is larger than the sender's balance. These issues could lead to incorrect balance calculations or unexpected behavior during token transactions. However, since the contract uses uint256 for balanceOf, which is the maximum size for uint in Solidity, overflow is not possible in this context. Nevertheless, it is considered good practice to use SafeMath or Solidity 0.8.x built-in overflow checks for added security.
