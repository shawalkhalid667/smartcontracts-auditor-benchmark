0. The contract uses call.value() in an unsafe manner, which can lead to reentrancy attacks. Specifically, the line 'if(!contract_address.call(bytes4(keccak256("transfer(address,uint256)")),c2,k)) return false;' is problematic as it makes an external call without proper validation or reentrancy guards. This external call happens before any state change, allowing a malicious contract to potentially call back into the transfer function before the state is updated, leading to reentrancy. The access control is minimal, as there are no checks on who can call the transfer function, exacerbating the risk of reentrancy attacks.
