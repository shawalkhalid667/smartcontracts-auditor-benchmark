0. The contract uses block.coinbase, msg.sender, block.difficulty, and block.number in a way that can be manipulated by miners, leading to potential vulnerabilities related to time manipulation, bad randomness, and miner exploitation. Specifically, in the function chooseWinner(), the seeds used to generate random numbers can be manipulated by miners to influence the outcome of the raffle. The use of block.coinbase and msg.sender as addresses can be controlled by miners, and block.difficulty and block.number can be manipulated to affect the outcome of the raffle. This impacts the precision of time measurements used in critical operations, as the contract relies on block.number to reset the raffle state, which can be exploited by miners to their advantage. The contract does not use any other external sources of time measurement that could mitigate this risk.
