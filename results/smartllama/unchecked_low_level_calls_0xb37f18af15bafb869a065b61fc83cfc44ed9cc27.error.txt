0. The contract uses call.value() in the sendMoney function, which is a known source of vulnerabilities. Specifically, line 33 contains the vulnerable code:'msg.sender.transfer(_value);'. This external call happens before any state change, allowing for potential reentrancy attacks where an attacker could call back into the contract before the state is updated. The access control mechanism is properly implemented using modifiers, but it does not prevent reentrancy due to the order of operations around external calls.
