0. The contract contains a reentrancy vulnerability in the CashOut function. Specifically, line 27 uses msg.sender.call.value(_am)() before updating the balance (line 28). This order of operations allows an attacker to make a recursive call back into the CashOut function before the balance is deducted, potentially draining the contract of funds. This vulnerability is related to access control as it allows any user to call CashOut without proper checks, and to internal function implementation where state changes occur after external calls.
