0. The contract uses call.value() in the sendMoney function, which is a known source of vulnerabilities. Specifically, line 33 contains the vulnerable code: '_target.call.value(_value)(_data);'. This external call happens before any state change, allowing for potential reentrancy attacks where an attacker could call back into the contract before the state is updated. The access control mechanism is properly implemented with the onlyOwner modifier, but it does not prevent reentrancy attacks from external contracts controlled by malicious actors. The internal function implementation does not include safeguards against reentrancy, such as mutexes or require statements that check the state before making external calls.
