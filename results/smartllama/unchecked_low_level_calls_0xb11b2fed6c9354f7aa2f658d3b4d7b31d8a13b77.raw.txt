=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract contains an unchecked low-level call vulnerability in the Proxy contract's proxy function. The target.call.value(msg.value)(data) line executes an arbitrary call to any contract address with the provided data and Ether from the msg.value. This can lead to unintended interactions where the called contract could manipulate the state of the calling contract, including changing the Owner variable or accessing the Deposits mapping. There is no access control mechanism preventing malicious contracts from being called, making this vulnerability exploitable by anyone who controls the target address. The lack of input validation on the target address also contributes to the risk, as any address can be used without checking if it's safe.
