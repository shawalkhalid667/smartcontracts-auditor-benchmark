=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses block.timestamp as a seed for random number generation which can be manipulated by miners (time manipulation). The calculation of seed uses block.number and blockhash which can be influenced by miners (denial of service). The precision of the random number generation is not high enough to prevent manipulation (bad randomness). There are no access controls on the random function which could be exploited by miners (access control). The use of block.timestamp as a seed can be influenced by miners to manipulate the outcome of the random number generation (front running). The arithmetic operations used to generate the seed and random number can lead to vulnerabilities if the results are relied upon for critical operations (arithmetic). The other potential vulnerabilities include the use of block.timestamp which can be manipulated by miners to influence the outcome of the random number generation.
