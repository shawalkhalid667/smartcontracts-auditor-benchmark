0. The contract uses access control correctly with the onlyowner modifier ensuring that only the owner can call the withdraw function. The constructor sets the owner and there are no unchecked low-level calls, time manipulations, bad randomness, denial of service, front-running, short addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic issues, or other vulnerabilities present. The code is secure against attacks due to the use of access control and proper function visibility modifiers.
