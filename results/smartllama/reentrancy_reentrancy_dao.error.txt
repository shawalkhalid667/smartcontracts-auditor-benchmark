0. The contract uses call.value() in the withdrawAll() function, which is a known source of reentrancy vulnerabilities. Specifically, line 18 contains the vulnerable code: 'bool callResult = msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)();'. This external call happens before the credit balance is set to zero, allowing for a reentrant attack where an attacker can withdraw funds repeatedly by calling withdrawAll() again before the credit balance is reset. This vulnerability is related to the order of operations and access control, as the external call should ideally happen after the credit balance is set to zero to prevent reentrancy.
