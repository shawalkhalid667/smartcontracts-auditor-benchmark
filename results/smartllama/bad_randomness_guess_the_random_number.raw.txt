=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses block.blockhash(block.number - 1) which is a low-level call and can potentially be manipulated by miners. The use of now (block.timestamp) can also be manipulated by miners. The combination of these two sources of entropy does not create a truly random number that cannot be influenced by external factors. Specifically, line 15 where the answer is set using keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now) is vulnerable to manipulation by miners who control the blockhash and can influence the timestamp to some extent. This vulnerability relates to unchecked low-level calls, time manipulation, and bad randomness. The precision of the entropy sources used does not result in a random number that is secure against manipulation.
