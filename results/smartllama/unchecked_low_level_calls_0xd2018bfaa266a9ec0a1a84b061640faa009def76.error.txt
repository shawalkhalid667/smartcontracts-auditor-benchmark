0. The contract contains unchecked low-level calls. In function Get(), line 17, there is a transfer of funds using msg.sender.transfer(this.balance) which is equivalent to call.value(). This operation is not protected against reentrancy as it occurs after checking msg.value but before any state change that would prevent further withdrawal. In function Command(), line 26, there is also a use of call.value() without proper validation post the external call. These issues relate to access control as they allow any user to trigger potentially unsafe state changes depending on the address and data passed to Command(). The arithmetic aspect is not applicable in this context as there are no arithmetic operations that could lead to vulnerabilities.
