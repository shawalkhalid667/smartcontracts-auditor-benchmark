1. The contract uses msg.sender.send() which is equivalent to call.value(). This is a low-level call that can potentially lead to reentrancy attacks. Specifically, line 14 where msg.sender.send(amountToWithdraw) is called, an attacker could potentially call withdrawBalance(), receive funds, and then recursively call withdrawBalance() again before the balance is set to zero. This order of operations where state changes happen after external calls is a common pattern leading to reentrancy vulnerabilities. Access control is minimal as anyone can call withdrawBalance(), and there are no checks to prevent reentrant calls. The internal function implementation exacerbates the issue by not properly safeguarding against reentrancy.
