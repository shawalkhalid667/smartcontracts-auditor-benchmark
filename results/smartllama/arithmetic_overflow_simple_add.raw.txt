You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses the 'balance' variable which is of type uint256. In the 'add' function, the operation 'balance += deposit' is performed without any checks. This operation could result in an overflow if the sum exceeds the maximum value of uint256. The maximum value of uint256 is 2^256 - 1. If 'deposit' is such a large number that the sum exceeds this maximum value, it will wrap around to a smaller number, potentially resulting in a smaller balance than before the addition. This is considered a vulnerability as it could allow an attacker to manipulate the balance in unexpected ways. The vulnerability is related to arithmetic operations, specifically addition, and the lack of overflow checks.
