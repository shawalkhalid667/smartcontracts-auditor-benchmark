0. The contract uses blockhash which is a known source of unpredictability due to the way it handles block numbers. Specifically, line 19 where the answer is set to blockhash(guesses[msg.sender].block) is vulnerable. Blockhash returns zero for blocks numbers that are more than 256 blocks ago so you can guess zero and wait. This is a form of time manipulation as it relies on the passage of time to generate a valid hash. The precision of blockhash is also an issue as it only returns the last 256 bytes of the block data, which can be manipulated by miners to some extent. The use of blockhash in this context does not provide a truly random outcome and can be exploited by miners who have control over when blocks are mined. The time constraint in settle() function on line 19 also introduces a risk as it relies on the passage of time to generate a valid hash, which can be manipulated by miners to some extent.
