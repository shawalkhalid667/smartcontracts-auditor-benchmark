0. The contract contains a reentrancy vulnerability in the Collect function. Specifically, line with 'if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())' is problematic. This external call happens before updating the account balance ('acc.balance-=_am;'). An attacker could potentially call Collect, receive Ether, and then recursively call Collect again before the balance is updated, leading to reentrancy. This issue is related to the order of operations where state changes should occur before external calls to prevent reentrancy attacks.
