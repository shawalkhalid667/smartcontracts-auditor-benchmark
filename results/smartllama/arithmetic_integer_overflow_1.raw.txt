=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses a simple arithmetic operation that could potentially lead to an overflow. The 'add' function adds 'value' to'sellerBalance' without checking if the addition would cause an overflow. If a large value is passed, it could cause'sellerBalance' to overflow, wrapping around to a smaller number. This could lead to unintended behavior where the sellerBalance appears to decrease instead of increase. The vulnerability relates to the lack of input validation and the use of unchecked arithmetic operations. The target value is 1, indicating that this is a low-level vulnerability that could be exploited by attackers to manipulate the contract state.
