0. The contract uses block.timestamp (now) in the lockTime mapping which can be manipulated by miners. This is a time manipulation vulnerability. Specifically, in the withdraw function, the requirement 'now > lockTime[msg.sender]' can be exploited by miners who have control over the timestamp of the blocks they mine. This can lead to premature unlocking of funds or extension of the lock period. The precision of time measurements used in the contract logic can also lead to vulnerabilities if the miner manipulates the timestamp to fall just before or after the lock period, affecting the arithmetic operations related to time.
