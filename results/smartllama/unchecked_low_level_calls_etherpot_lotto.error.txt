0. The contract uses call.value() in the cash() function at line 109, which is a known vulnerability for reentrancy attacks. Specifically, the line 'winner.send(subpot);' sends ether to the winner before updating the state variable 'isCashed'. If the winner's contract is malicious, it can call back into the Lotto contract before the state is updated, potentially draining the contract of funds. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of proper access control mechanisms that could restrict who can call the cash() function. The internal function implementation does not adequately separate state-changing operations from external calls, making the contract susceptible to reentrancy attacks.
