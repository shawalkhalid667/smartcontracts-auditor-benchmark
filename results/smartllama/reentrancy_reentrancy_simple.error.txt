0. The contract uses call.value() in the withdrawBalance() function which can potentially lead to reentrancy attacks. Specifically, line 24 where the external call is made before resetting the balance. This order of operations allows an attacker to call withdrawBalance(), receive funds, and then recursively call withdrawBalance() again before the balance is reset. The lack of proper access control exacerbates this issue as anyone can call withdrawBalance(). The vulnerability is related to both reentrancy and access control categories.
