0. The contract uses call.value() in donateToWhale() and loseWager(), which can potentially lead to unchecked low-level calls vulnerabilities. Specifically, lines 198 and 210 are problematic as they make external calls without proper validation or reentrancy guards. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the contract's state or cause it to enter an invalid state. The lack of access control around these functions also contributes to the risk, as any user can trigger these functions through the play() function.
