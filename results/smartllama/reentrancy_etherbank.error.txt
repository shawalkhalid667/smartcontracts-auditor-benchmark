0. The contract uses call.value() in the withdrawBalance() function which can potentially lead to reentrancy attacks. Specifically, line 21 where the external call is made before resetting the balance of the user. This order of operations allows for a malicious contract to call withdrawBalance(), receive Ether, and then recursively call withdrawBalance() again before the balance is set to zero. This vulnerability is related to access control as it allows any user to withdraw their balance without proper checks or safeguards against reentrant calls. The internal function implementation does not adequately protect against external calls that could manipulate the contract's state.
