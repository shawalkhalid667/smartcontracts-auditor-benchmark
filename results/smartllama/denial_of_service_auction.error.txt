0. The contract uses send() which is equivalent to call.value(). This can potentially lead to denial of service if the recipient contract is malicious and reverts the transaction. Specifically, line 9 where the refund is sent to the current frontrunner is vulnerable. If the recipient contract is set to revert(), it will prevent the currentBid from being updated, allowing the same bidder to win repeatedly. This vulnerability is related to both access control and denial of service as it allows for manipulation of the auction state by a single bidder who can control when transactions fail.
