0. The contract uses call.value() in a way that could potentially lead to front-running attacks. Specifically, in the function 'play', the line 'if (msg.value!= 1 ether) throw;' checks the value sent by the player, but does not ensure that the transaction is mined before the state is updated. This order of operations allows for a malicious contract to call 'play' and then, during the execution of 'andTheWinnerIs', withdraw funds before the state is reset. The lack of proper access control in 'getProfit' also poses a risk, as it allows anyone who controls the owner address to withdraw funds.
