=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.


=== USER ===
Return ONLY the JSON object described in the system message.

SOLIDITY_SOURCE_END


=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses send() which is equivalent to call.value(). This can potentially lead to denial of service attacks if one of the recipients is malicious and reverts the transaction after receiving funds. The refundAll() function performs multiple external calls without proper ordering or checks in between, allowing for potential reentrancy attacks where a malicious contract could call back into the refundAll() function before all refunds are processed. Access control is not implemented, allowing anyone to call refundAll(). The internal function implementation does not include safeguards against reentrancy or checks for failed transactions.
