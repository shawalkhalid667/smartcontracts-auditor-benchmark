0. The contract uses a simple function that pushes addresses to a list without any external calls or interactions that could lead to reentrancy. The function uses a loop to push addresses to the list but does not use any external calls or delegatecalls that could be exploited. The function also checks the length of the list before pushing addresses, which is a good practice to prevent overflow. The critical section is line 17 where the function checks if the list length is less than 1500 before pushing addresses. This check ensures that the function does not run indefinitely and that the list does not grow too large. However, if the function is called by multiple users simultaneously, it could potentially be exploited by filling up the list quickly. The function does not use any external calls that could lead to reentrancy, and there are no state changes that occur after external calls. Therefore, the contract is secure against reentrancy attacks. The access control is implicit as the function does not restrict who can call it, but since there are no external calls that could lead to reentrancy, this does not pose a security risk. The internal function implementation is straightforward and does not introduce any security risks related to external calls or reentrancy.
