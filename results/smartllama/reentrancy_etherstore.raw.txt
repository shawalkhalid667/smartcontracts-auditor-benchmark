=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.


=== USER ===
Return ONLY the JSON object described in the system message.

SOLIDITY_SOURCE_END


=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses call.value() in the withdrawFunds function, which is a known source of reentrancy vulnerabilities. Specifically, line 27 contains the vulnerable code:'require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)());'. This external call happens before the state is updated to reflect the withdrawal, allowing for a potential reentrancy attack where an attacker could call withdrawFunds again before the balance is deducted. This vulnerability is related to the order of operations and access control, as the contract does not properly manage the sequence of state changes and external calls.
