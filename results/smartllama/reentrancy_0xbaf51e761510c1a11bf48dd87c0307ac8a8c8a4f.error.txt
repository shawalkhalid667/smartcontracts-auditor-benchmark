0. The contract contains a reentrancy vulnerability in the CashOut function. Specifically, line 27 uses msg.sender.call.value(_am)() before updating the balance (line 28). This order of operations allows an attacker to make a recursive call back into the CashOut function before the balance is deducted, potentially draining the contract of funds. The vulnerability is exacerbated by lack of proper access control, as any address can call CashOut without restrictions.
