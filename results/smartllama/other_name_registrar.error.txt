0. The contract does not use call.value(), nor does it have any arithmetic operations that could lead to vulnerabilities. There are no unchecked low-level calls or time manipulations present. The use of 'unlocked' variable for access control is appropriate, although it lacks granularity for different types of operations. The'register' function initializes storage correctly without any issues. Therefore, the code is secure against the target vulnerabilities.
