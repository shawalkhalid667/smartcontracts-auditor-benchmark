0. The contract uses call.value() in the Collect function, which is a known source of reentrancy vulnerabilities. Specifically, line 47 contains the vulnerable code: 'if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())'. This external call happens before the balance is updated, allowing for a reentrant attack where an attacker can withdraw funds repeatedly before the balance is deducted. This vulnerability is related to the order of operations and access control, as the external call should be made after updating the balance to prevent reentrancy.
