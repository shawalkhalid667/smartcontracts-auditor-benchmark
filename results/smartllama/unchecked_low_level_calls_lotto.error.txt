0. The contract uses low-level calls (send) without checking the success of the transaction, which is a vulnerability related to unchecked low-level calls. Specifically, in the functions sendToWinner() and withdrawLeftOver(), the send() function is used to transfer Ether to the winner and leftover balance to the caller respectively. There is no check to ensure that the transaction was successful, which could allow an attacker to manipulate the contract state if the recipient contract is malicious. This vulnerability is present at lines 20 and 27 where the send() function is called.
