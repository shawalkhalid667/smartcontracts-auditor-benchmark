0. The contract contains a reentrancy vulnerability in the CashOut function. Specifically, line 38 uses msg.sender.call.value(_am)() before updating the balance. This order of operations allows an attacker to make a recursive call back into the CashOut function before the balance is deducted, potentially draining the contract of funds. The vulnerability is exacerbated by the lack of proper access control mechanisms that could restrict who can call the CashOut function.
