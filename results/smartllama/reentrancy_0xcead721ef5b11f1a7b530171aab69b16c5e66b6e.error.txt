0. The contract uses call.value() in the Collect function, which is a known source of reentrancy vulnerabilities. Specifically, line 29 contains the vulnerable code: 'if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())'. This external call happens before the state is updated to reflect the withdrawal of funds, allowing for a potential reentrancy attack where an attacker could call Collect again before the balance is reduced. This vulnerability is related to the order of operations and access control, as the external call should ideally happen after the balance is updated to prevent reentrancy.
