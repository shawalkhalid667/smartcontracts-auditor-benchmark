You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

SOLIDITY_SOURCE_END


=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses call.value() in the withdrawAll() function, which is a known source of reentrancy vulnerabilities. Specifically, line 18 contains the vulnerable code: 'bool callResult = msg.sender.call.value(oCredit)();'. This external call happens before the credit balance is set to zero, allowing for a reentrant attack where an attacker can withdraw funds repeatedly by calling withdrawAll() again before the credit balance is reset. This vulnerability is related to the order of operations and access control, as the external call should ideally happen after the credit balance is set to zero to prevent reentrancy.
