0. The contract uses call.value() in the withdrawReward function which can potentially lead to reentrancy attacks. Specifically, line 28 where the external call is made before updating the balance of the recipient. This order of operations allows for a malicious contract to call back into the withdrawReward function before the balance is updated, leading to unauthorized withdrawal of funds. Access control does not prevent this attack as any address can call withdrawReward. The internal function implementation exacerbates the issue by not checking if the call was successful or if the recipient's balance has been updated.
