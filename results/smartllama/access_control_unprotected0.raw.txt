=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract does not use any low-level calls that could lead to vulnerabilities. There is no use of call.value() or any other form of Ether transfer that could be exploited. The order of operations does not place external calls before state changes, eliminating potential reentrancy attacks. There are no time constraints in critical operations that could be manipulated by miners. The access control mechanism is present through the onlyowner modifier, preventing unauthorized access to functions like changeOwner(). The internal function implementation does not introduce any additional risks as there are no unprotected internal functions that interact with external contracts. Therefore, the code is secure against all the target vulnerabilities.
