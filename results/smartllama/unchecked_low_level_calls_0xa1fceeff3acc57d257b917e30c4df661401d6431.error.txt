0. The contract uses call.value() in an unsafe manner, which is a common source of vulnerabilities. Specifically, in the transfer function, the line 'contract_address.call(id, msg.sender, tos[i], vs[i]);' is problematic because it makes an external call without checking the success of the transaction or reverting the state changes in case of failure. This can lead to reentrancy attacks where an attacker can withdraw funds repeatedly before the state is updated. Additionally, there is no access control mechanism preventing unauthorized addresses from being used as contract_address, increasing the risk of exploitation. The internal function implementation does not handle errors gracefully, as it does not check the return value of the call or revert the state changes in case of failure.
