=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

Return ONLY the JSON object described in the system message.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses block.number as a source of randomness which is highly predictable and can be manipulated by miners. This is a critical issue as it affects the fairness of the lottery system. Specifically, line numbers 38 and 42 are vulnerable where block.number is used to determine if the user won or not. This can be exploited by miners who have control over the block number creation, allowing them to manipulate the outcome of bets. The precision of block.number does not provide sufficient randomness to ensure fair outcomes, making the contract vulnerable to manipulation.
