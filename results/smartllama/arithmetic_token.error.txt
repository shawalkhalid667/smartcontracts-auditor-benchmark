0. The contract uses Solidity's default overflow protection, which was introduced in version 0.8.0. This protection ensures that arithmetic operations do not result in overflows or underflows. Specifically, in the transfer function, the line'require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);' ensures that the subtraction operation will not result in an underflow. Similarly, the addition operation is safe because Solidity automatically checks for overflow. Therefore, there are no arithmetic vulnerabilities present in the contract.
