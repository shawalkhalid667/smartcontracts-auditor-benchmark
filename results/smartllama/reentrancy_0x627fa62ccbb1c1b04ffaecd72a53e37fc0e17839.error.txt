0. The contract uses call.value() in the WithdrawToHolder function, which is a known source of reentrancy vulnerabilities. Specifically, line 94 contains the vulnerable code: if(_addr.call.value(_wei)()) { Holders[_addr]-=_wei; }. This order of operations allows an attacker to make a call before the state is updated, enabling reentrancy. The access control mechanism is present through the onlyOwner modifier, but it does not prevent reentrancy attacks once the call.value() is executed. The internal function implementation does not adequately protect against reentrancy by ensuring that state changes occur before external calls.
