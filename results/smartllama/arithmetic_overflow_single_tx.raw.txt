=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The code is secure against arithmetic overflow/underflow attacks. The contract uses Solidity's built-in overflow/underflow checks, which are automatically enabled in Solidity 0.8.x and higher. This means that any arithmetic operation that would result in an overflow or underflow will revert the transaction, preventing any potential vulnerabilities. Specifically, the functions 'overflowaddtostate', 'overflowmultostate', 'underflowtostate', 'overflowlocalonly', 'overflowmulocalonly', and 'underflowlocalonly' all perform arithmetic operations that are protected by these built-in checks. There is no use of the 'unchecked' keyword, ensuring that all arithmetic operations are checked for overflow/underflow. Additionally, there are no critical operations involving token transfers, balance updates, or price calculations that could be susceptible to these vulnerabilities. Therefore, the contract is secure against arithmetic overflow/underflow attacks.
