0. The contract does not use call.value(), thus avoiding one common source of reentrancy vulnerabilities. However, the order of operations in the attack contract's supportsToken() function is problematic. It first calls airDrop() before returning the expected value, allowing for a reentrancy attack where the attacker's balance is increased before the function completes. This is exacerbated by the lack of proper access control mechanisms in the ModifierEntrancy contract, which does not restrict who can call airDrop(). The internal function implementation in ModifierEntrancy also contributes to the vulnerability, as there is no check to ensure that the balance increase does not exceed the maximum balance allowed for an address.
