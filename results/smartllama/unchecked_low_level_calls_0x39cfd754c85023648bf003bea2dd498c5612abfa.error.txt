0. The contract uses call.value() in the WithdrawToHolder function, which is a known source of vulnerabilities due to potential reentrancy attacks. Specifically, line 97 contains the vulnerable code: '_addr.call.value(_wei);'. This external call happens before updating the state variable Holders[_addr], allowing for a reentrant attack where an attacker could call back into the WithdrawToHolder function before the state is updated, leading to unauthorized withdrawal of funds. Access control is enforced through the onlyOwner modifier, but it does not prevent reentrancy attacks from happening within the scope of authorized functions.
