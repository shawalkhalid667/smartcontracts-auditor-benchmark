0. The contract uses block.timestamp in a way that can be manipulated by miners, leading to potential time manipulation vulnerabilities. Specifically, the line 'var random = uint(sha3(block.timestamp)) % 2;' uses block.timestamp as a seed for random number generation, which can be manipulated by miners to influence the outcome of the lottery game. This manipulation can lead to unfair advantages for certain participants, as well as potential denial of service attacks where miners could prevent certain outcomes by controlling the timestamp. The precision of block.timestamp is also a concern, as it is subject to miner manipulation and does not provide a truly random outcome.
