=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses block.blockhash(lastBlockNumber) which can be manipulated by miners, leading to potential time manipulation vulnerabilities. Specifically, line 127 uses block.blockhash(lastBlockNumber) to generate a random number, which can be influenced by miners to manipulate the outcome of the random number generation process. This impacts the fairness of the payout system as it relies on randomness for determining which entry to payout next. Miners could potentially exploit this by controlling when blocks are mined to influence the outcome of the random number generation, leading to unfair advantages or losses for users. The precision of time measurements used in line 127 can also be exploited due to the reliance on block.blockhash(lastBlockNumber), as miners have control over when blocks are mined, thus affecting the outcome of the random number generation process.
