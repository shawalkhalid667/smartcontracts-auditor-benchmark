0. The contract uses call.value() in an unsafe manner, which can lead to reentrancy attacks. Specifically, in the transfer function, the loop that iterates over _tos array calls caddress.call() without checking the success of the call or reverting the state changes in case of failure. This can allow an attacker to call back into the contract during the execution of transfer, potentially draining funds. The lack of proper access control mechanisms exacerbates this issue as any address can be passed as caddress, allowing anyone to attempt a reentrancy attack.
