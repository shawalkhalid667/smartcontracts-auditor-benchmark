0. The contract does not use call.value() or delegatecall(), which are common sources of vulnerabilities. The refund() function uses msg.sender.transfer(), which is safer than call.value(). There are no time constraints in critical operations that could be exploited by miners. Access control is implemented through the creator variable, ensuring that only the creator can migrate funds using the migrateTo() function. The order of operations in functions like withdraw() and refund() ensures that state changes happen before Ether is transferred, preventing reentrancy attacks. Arithmetic operations are handled correctly without overflow or underflow issues. Overall, the contract's security is sound against the target vulnerabilities.
