0. The code is secure against smart contract attacks. The contract uses SafeMath library functions for arithmetic operations which prevent overflow and underflow issues. There is no use of call.value() or any other low-level call functions that could lead to reentrancy attacks. Access control is implemented through modifiers like onlyOwner, whenNotPaused, and whenPaused, ensuring that critical functions are only accessible to authorized addresses. The internal function implementation follows best practices, with state changes occurring before any external calls. Overall, the contract's design and implementation effectively mitigate the risk of smart contract attacks.
