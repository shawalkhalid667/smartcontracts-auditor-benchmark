0. The contract uses call.value() in the WithdrawToHolder function, which is a known source of vulnerabilities due to potential reentrancy attacks. Specifically, line 97 shows '_addr.call.value(_wei);', where an attacker could potentially call back into the contract before the state is updated to reflect the withdrawal. This issue is related to both unchecked low-level calls and reentrancy vulnerabilities. Access control is implemented through the onlyOwner modifier, but it does not prevent reentrancy attacks from happening once the funds are transferred. The internal function implementation does not adequately protect against reentrancy by ensuring that state changes occur before external calls.
