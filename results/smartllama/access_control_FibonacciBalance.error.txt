0. The contract uses delegatecall in a way that could potentially allow unauthorized access to critical functions. Specifically, in the FibonacciBalance contract, the withdraw() function uses delegatecall to call a function in the FibonacciLib contract without proper access control. This could allow any user to call the withdraw() function and potentially manipulate the calculatedFibNumber or other state variables in the FibonacciLib contract. Additionally, the fallback function in FibonacciBalance allows any user to call delegatecall on the FibonacciLib contract, which could allow manipulation of state variables or execution of unauthorized functions. These issues relate to access control and could lead to unauthorized access to critical functions.
