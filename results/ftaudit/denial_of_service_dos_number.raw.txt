=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses a simple array structure to store numbers and performs basic operations like inserting numbers and clearing the array. There are no external calls or use of block.timestamp that could introduce vulnerabilities related to time manipulation or bad randomness. The functions 'insertNnumbers', 'clear', and 'clearDOS' are susceptible to denial of service attacks due to the use of loops without proper checks or limits on gas consumption. Specifically, lines 18-22 show the vulnerability where the loop counter 'i' is not checked against any limit, allowing it to grow arbitrarily large without ensuring sufficient gas is available. This could lead to a denial of service if the operation is interrupted by a gas limit error. The 'clearDOS' function also has a similar issue where the array length is increased without checking if there is enough gas to perform the operation.
