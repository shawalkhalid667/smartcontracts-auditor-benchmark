1. The contract uses the deprecated'send' method which is equivalent to call.value(). This can lead to reentrancy attacks where an attacker can withdraw funds repeatedly before the balance is set to zero. The order of operations is also problematic as the balance is set to zero before the external call is made. This sequence allows an attacker to withdraw funds repeatedly without the balance being updated. The vulnerability is related to unchecked low-level calls, reentrancy, and access control as there is no check to ensure that the caller cannot make further withdrawals once the balance has been set to zero.
