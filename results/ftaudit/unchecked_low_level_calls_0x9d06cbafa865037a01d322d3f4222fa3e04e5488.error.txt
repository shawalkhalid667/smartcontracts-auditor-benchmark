0. The contract uses call.value() in the tokens_buy() function at line 54, which is an unchecked low-level call. This can potentially lead to reentrancy attacks if the recipient contract calls back into the contract before the state is updated. Specifically, the line 'owner2.send(sum2);' sends Ether to owner2 without updating the contract's state first. Similarly, in the withdraw() function at line 65, there is another unchecked low-level call to owner.send(balance), which could also lead to reentrancy if the recipient contract calls back into the contract before the balance is updated. These vulnerabilities are related to unchecked low-level calls, time manipulation, bad randomness, denial of service, front-running, access control, short addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, and other issues.
