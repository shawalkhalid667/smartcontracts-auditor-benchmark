0. The contract uses'send()' which is equivalent to call.value() and can potentially lead to denial of service if the recipient contract reverts. Specifically, line 9 contains the vulnerable code:'require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));'. This operation is susceptible to denial of service because if the recipient contract reverts, the entire transaction will revert, allowing the bidder to win without having to pay the previous frontrunner. This vulnerability is related to unchecked low-level calls, time manipulation, bad randomness, denial of service, front-running, access control, short addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, and other issues.
