0. The contract uses msg.sender.transfer() which is equivalent to call.value(). This can potentially lead to front-running attacks if the transfer happens before the state is updated to reflect that the ether has been sent. Specifically, in the function'solve', the transfer of ether occurs before updating the state to reflect that the ether has been sent. This order of operations allows for a malicious contract to call back into'solve' before the state is updated, leading to a front-running attack. The vulnerability is exacerbated by the lack of proper access control mechanisms that could prevent unauthorized calls to'solve'.
