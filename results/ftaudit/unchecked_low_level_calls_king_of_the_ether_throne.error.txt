0. The contract uses low-level calls in several instances which can lead to vulnerabilities. Specifically, in the function 'claimThrone', lines containing'msg.sender.send(valuePaid)' and 'currentMonarch.etherAddress.send(compensation)' use low-level calls without proper protection against reentrancy. These calls are made before updating the state variables, allowing for potential reentrancy attacks where an attacker could withdraw funds repeatedly by calling back into the contract before the state is updated. Additionally, in the'sweepCommission' function, 'wizardAddress.send(amount)' is used without ensuring that the sweep has been authorized or checking for reentrancy. Access control is implemented through the 'onlywizard' modifier, but it does not prevent reentrancy attacks once control is transferred to external contracts. The arithmetic operations are sound, but they do not mitigate the risk of reentrancy when interacting with external contracts. Overall, the contract's design does not adequately protect against reentrancy vulnerabilities due to unchecked low-level calls and lack of proper ordering of operations.
