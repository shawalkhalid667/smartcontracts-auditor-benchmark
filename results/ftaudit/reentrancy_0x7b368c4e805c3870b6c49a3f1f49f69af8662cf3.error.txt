0. The contract uses call.value() in the Collect function, which is a known source of reentrancy vulnerabilities. Specifically, line 29 contains the vulnerable code: 'if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())'. This external call happens before the state change (acc.balance-=_am), allowing for a potential reentrancy attack where an attacker could withdraw funds repeatedly by calling the Collect function again before the balance is updated. Access control does not prevent this attack as any user can call the Collect function once they meet the conditions set by the contract.
