0. The contract uses call.value() in the Collect function, which is a known source of reentrancy vulnerabilities. Specifically, line 29 contains the vulnerable code: 'if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())'. This external call happens before the state change (acc.balance-=_am), allowing for a potential reentrancy attack where an attacker could withdraw funds repeatedly by calling the Collect function again before the balance is updated. This issue is related to the order of operations and access control, as the external call should ideally happen after updating the balance to prevent reentrancy.
