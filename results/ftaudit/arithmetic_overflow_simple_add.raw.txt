=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
1. The contract uses the 'balance' variable which is of type uint. In the 'add' function, the addition 'balance += deposit' is performed without any checks. If the sum of 'balance' and 'deposit' exceeds the maximum value of uint, it will cause an overflow. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, this would result in an incorrect value of 'balance', potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the balance arbitrarily. In versions 0.8.0 and later, the transaction would revert, but it's still considered a vulnerability as it could lead to denial of service or unexpected behavior if not properly handled. This vulnerability is related to arithmetic operations, specifically overflow, and it's considered a low-risk vulnerability due to the nature of uint variables and the fact that Solidity versions 0.8.0 and later revert on overflow by default.
