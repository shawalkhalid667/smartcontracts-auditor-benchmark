1. The contract uses call.value() in donateToWhale() and loseWager(), which can lead to unchecked low-level calls. Specifically, lines 198 and 210 contain the vulnerable code. These functions transfer Ether to the whale without checking the success of the transaction or reverting the state changes in case of failure. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the lack of proper access control around these functions, allowing any external contract to trigger them through the fallback function. The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker could potentially drain the contract's funds by recursively calling these functions.
