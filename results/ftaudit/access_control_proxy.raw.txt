=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.


=== USER ===

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses delegatecall in the forward function which can potentially lead to access control issues if the callee contract is malicious. However, since the contract does not restrict who can call the forward function, it is not possible to determine if there is a specific vulnerability without knowing the context in which delegatecall is used. Assuming delegatecall is used to interact with trusted contracts or internal functions, the current setup does not introduce obvious vulnerabilities related to access control. Nevertheless, it is crucial to ensure that the callee contract is properly validated before using delegatecall to prevent potential attacks.
