1. The contract uses call.value() in the Collect function, which is a known source of reentrancy vulnerabilities. Specifically, line 54 contains the vulnerable code: 'if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())'. This external call happens before the balance is updated, allowing for a potential reentrancy attack where an attacker could withdraw funds repeatedly by calling the Collect function again before the balance is deducted. This issue is related to the order of operations and access control, as the external call should ideally happen after the balance has been deducted to prevent reentrancy.
