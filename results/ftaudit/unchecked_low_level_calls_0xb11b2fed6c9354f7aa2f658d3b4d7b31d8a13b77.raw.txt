=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

Return ONLY the JSON object described in the system message.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses call.value() in the proxy function of the Proxy contract, which is a known source of vulnerabilities due to unchecked low-level calls. Specifically, line 14 contains the vulnerable code: 'target.call.value(msg.value)(data);'. This external call happens before any state change, allowing for potential reentrancy attacks where an attacker could call back into the contract during the execution of the proxy function. Access control is implemented through the onlyOwner modifier, but it does not prevent reentrancy attacks originating from trusted sources. The internal function implementation does not adequately safeguard against reentrant calls made within the context of the proxy function.
