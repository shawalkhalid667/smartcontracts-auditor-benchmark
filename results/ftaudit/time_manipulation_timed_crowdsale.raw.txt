=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses block.timestamp in a critical operation, which can be manipulated by miners. Specifically, the isSaleFinished() function checks if the current time is greater than or equal to 1546300800, which corresponds to January 1, 2019. This time constraint is crucial as it determines when the sale ends, and miners could potentially manipulate the timestamp to extend or shorten the sale period. The precision of block.timestamp is at the second level, which might not be sufficient for precise time measurements required in financial contracts like this one. The vulnerability relates to time manipulation, where miners can adjust the timestamp to their advantage, affecting the contract's logic and potentially leading to financial loss.
