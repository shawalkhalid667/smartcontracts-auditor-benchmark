0. The contract does not use any external libraries or have complex internal function implementations that could introduce vulnerabilities. The withdrawAll function uses transfer, which is safe from reentrancy due to the lack of call.value(). Access control is implemented through the require statement, ensuring only the owner can call withdrawAll. There are no unchecked low-level calls, time manipulations, bad randomness, denial of service, front-running, short addresses, or arithmetic issues present. Therefore, the code is secure against the target vulnerabilities.
