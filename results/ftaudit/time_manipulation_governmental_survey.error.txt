1. The contract uses block.timestamp in a way that could be manipulated by miners, leading to potential time manipulation vulnerabilities. Specifically, in the function'resetInvestment()', the condition 'block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE' checks if enough time has passed since the last investment. This check is based on block.timestamp which can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to influence when the jackpot is reset. This impacts the precision of time measurements as the exact time when the jackpot should be reset is not fixed but depends on miner manipulation, leading to potential unfair advantages or losses for investors. The use of block.timestamp without proper safeguards against manipulation exposes the contract to vulnerabilities related to time precision and miner exploitation.
