0. The contract uses access control through the modifier onlyowner, which restricts the withdraw function to be called only by the owner. This is correct usage of access control mechanisms. There are no unchecked low-level calls, time manipulation, bad randomness, denial of service, front-running, short addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic vulnerabilities, or other issues present in the code. The constructor sets the owner correctly, and there are no issues with the fallback function or any other functions that could lead to vulnerabilities.
