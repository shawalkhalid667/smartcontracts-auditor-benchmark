=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
1. The contract uses blockhash which can be manipulated by miners. This is a time manipulation vulnerability. Specifically, in the function settle(), the line 'bytes32 answer = blockhash(guesses[msg.sender].block);' uses blockhash which can be manipulated by miners to affect the outcome of the game. This relates to the use of block.timestamp or now which can be controlled by miners to some extent. The precision of blockhash can also be exploited as it only returns the hash of blocks within a certain range of block numbers, making it predictable to some extent. However, the main issue is that miners can manipulate the outcome by controlling when blocks are mined, affecting the blockhash value. This impacts the fairness of the game as players cannot rely on the blockhash being truly random.
