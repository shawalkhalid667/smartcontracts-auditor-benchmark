0. The contract does not use block.timestamp or now, which are susceptible to miner manipulation. There are no time constraints in critical operations that rely on precise time measurements. Since there is no use of time-sensitive functions, there is no potential for miners to exploit time-dependent code. The precision of time measurements does not impact contract logic as there are no such measurements used. Therefore, the contract is secure against time manipulation vulnerabilities.
