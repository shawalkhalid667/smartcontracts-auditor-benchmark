0. The contract does not use SafeMath, but it does include a check in deposit() to prevent overflow. withdraw() uses require() to ensure the amount is valid before deducting it from the balance. refund() lacks access control, allowing any user to call it and potentially drain the contract. migrateTo() has proper access control but uses transfer(), which could lead to reentrancy if the recipient contract is malicious. Overall, the contract has vulnerabilities related to access control, reentrancy, and arithmetic operations.
