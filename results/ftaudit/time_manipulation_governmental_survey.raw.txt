You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
1. The contract uses block.timestamp in a way that could be manipulated by miners, leading to potential time manipulation vulnerabilities. Specifically, in the function'resetInvestment()', the condition 'block.timestamp < lastInvestmentTimestamp+ONE_MINUTE' checks if enough time has passed since the last investment. This check is based on block.timestamp which can be manipulated by miners, allowing them to influence when the jackpot is reset. This impacts the precision of time measurements as the exact time when the jackpot should be reset is not fixed but depends on miner manipulation, leading to potential unfair advantages or losses for investors. The use of block.timestamp without proper safeguards against manipulation exposes the contract to vulnerabilities related to time precision and miner exploitation.
