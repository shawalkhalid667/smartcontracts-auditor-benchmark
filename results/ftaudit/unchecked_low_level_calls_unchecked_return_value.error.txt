0. The contract uses low-level calls without proper checking in the function callnotchecked(address callee). This can lead to unexpected return values which might be exploited by malicious contracts. There is no access control mechanism implemented, allowing anyone to call this function. The lack of proper checking around the call operation can lead to denial of service if the callee contract is malicious and does not return properly. The vulnerability relates to unchecked low-level calls and access control issues.
