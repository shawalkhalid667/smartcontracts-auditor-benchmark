0. The code is secure against arithmetic attacks. The contract uses Solidity's built-in overflow checks, which are automatically enabled in Solidity 0.8.x and higher. These checks ensure that arithmetic operations do not result in overflows or underflows. Specifically, the functions 'overflowaddtostate', 'overflowmultostate', 'underflowtostate', 'overflowlocalonly', 'overflowmulocalonly', and 'underflowlocalonly' all use Solidity's safe arithmetic operations, which automatically revert transactions if an overflow or underflow occurs. There is no use of the 'unchecked' keyword, which would disable these safety checks. Additionally, there are no critical operations involving token transfers, balance updates, or price calculations that could be vulnerable to arithmetic attacks. The contract's simplicity and lack of complex arithmetic operations ensure that it is secure against arithmetic vulnerabilities.
