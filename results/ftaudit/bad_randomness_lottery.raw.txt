=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

Return ONLY the JSON object described in the system message.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses block.number as a source of randomness which is not secure as it can be manipulated by miners. Specifically, line 38 uses block.number % 2 to determine if the user won, which is vulnerable to manipulation by miners who can control the block number to some extent. This relates to the BAD_RANDOMNESS vulnerability category. The use of block.number as a source of randomness is not appropriate for critical operations like determining winners in a lottery system. The precision of block.number as a source of randomness is low, and it does not provide a truly random outcome that cannot be influenced by external factors.
