0. The contract uses call.value() in the WithdrawToHolder function, which is a known source of reentrancy vulnerabilities. Specifically, line 94 contains the vulnerable code: 'if(_addr.call.value(_wei)())'. This external call happens before the state change (Holders[_addr]-=_wei), allowing for a potential reentrancy attack where an attacker could withdraw funds repeatedly by calling the fallback function again before the state is updated. Access control is implemented through the onlyOwner modifier, but it does not prevent reentrancy attacks once the funds are transferred.
