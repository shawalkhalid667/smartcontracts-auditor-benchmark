0. The contract uses access control through the modifier onlyowner, which restricts the withdraw function to be called only by the owner. This is correct usage of access control. However, the constructor function does not have a proper name and does not restrict who can call it, which is not a security issue but a good practice issue. The contract does not use unchecked low-level calls, time manipulation, bad randomness, denial of service, front-running, short addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, or any other vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Therefore, the code is secure against smart contract attacks.
