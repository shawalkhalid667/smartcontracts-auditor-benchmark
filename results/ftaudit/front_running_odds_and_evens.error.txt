0. The contract uses call.value() in a way that could potentially allow front-running attacks. Specifically, in the function 'andTheWinnerIs()', the Ether is sent to the winner before resetting the game state. This order of operations allows for a malicious contract to call 'play()' again before the game state is reset, potentially leading to multiple winnings. The line of concern is where'res = players[0].addr.send(1800 finney);' and'res = players[1].addr.send(1800 finney);' are executed before 'delete players;' and 'tot=0;'. This vulnerability is related to the order of operations and the use of external calls without proper safeguards.
