0. The contract uses block.coinbase, msg.sender, block.difficulty, and block.number in a way that could lead to predictable random numbers, which is a vulnerability related to bad randomness. Specifically, in the function chooseWinner(), the seeds used to generate random numbers can be manipulated by miners. The line 'address seed1 = contestants[uint(block.coinbase) % totalTickets].addr;' uses block.coinbase as a seed which can be controlled by miners to influence the outcome of the raffle. Similarly, 'address seed2 = contestants[uint(msg.sender) % totalTickets].addr;' uses msg.sender as a seed that can be manipulated by miners to affect the outcome of the raffle. The use of block.difficulty ('uint seed3 = block.difficulty;') and block.number ('blockNumber = block.number;') as seeds can also be influenced by miners to some extent, affecting the outcome of the raffle. This vulnerability is related to all four focus points: use of block.coinbase, msg.sender, block.difficulty, and block.number as seeds; potential for miner manipulation; predictability of random numbers; and impact on contract logic.
