0. The contract uses call.value() in the WithdrawToHolder function which can lead to unchecked low-level calls. Specifically, line 97 contains the vulnerable code: '_addr.call.value(_wei);'. This external call happens before the state change (Holders[_addr]-=_wei), allowing for a potential reentrancy attack where the recipient contract could call back into the WithdrawToHolder function before the state is updated. Additionally, there is no access control mechanism preventing malicious contracts from being called, exacerbating the risk of reentrancy.
