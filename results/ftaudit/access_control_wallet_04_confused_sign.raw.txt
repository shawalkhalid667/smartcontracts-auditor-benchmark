=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses 'transfer()' in 'withdraw()' which is not recommended as it can lead to reentrancy attacks. However, since there is no external call before the state change, the order of operations does not allow for reentrancy in this context. The access control mechanism is present with'require()' statements ensuring that only valid transactions occur. There is no use of 'call.value()' which could potentially lead to unchecked low-level calls. Time manipulation is not applicable as there are no time-dependent functionalities. Bad randomness is not present as there are no random number generators used in critical operations. Denial of service is not possible due to the lack of external calls that could be exploited. Front-running is not applicable as there are no external calls that could be manipulated by miners. Overall, the contract is secure against the target vulnerabilities.
