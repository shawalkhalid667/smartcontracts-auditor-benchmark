You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

SOLIDITY_SOURCE_END


=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses call.value() in the withdrawAll() function which can potentially lead to reentrancy attacks. Specifically, line 18 where the external call is made before updating the credit of the sender to zero allows for a malicious contract to make recursive calls during the withdrawal process. This vulnerability is related to the order of operations where state changes should occur before any external calls to prevent reentrancy. Access control is not implemented effectively as any address can call the withdrawAll() function without restrictions. The internal function implementation does not adequately safeguard against reentrant calls by ensuring the credit is set to zero before the external call is made.
