0. The code is secure against arithmetic attacks. The contract uses Solidity version ^0.4.11 which includes built-in overflow checks for unsigned integers (uint). Specifically, the operation'map[k] -= v' is safe because Solidity versions prior to ^0.5.0 automatically revert transactions that would cause underflows or overflows. There is no use of the 'unchecked' keyword, ensuring that all arithmetic operations are checked for overflow. Additionally, there are no critical operations involving token transfers, balance updates, or price calculations that could be susceptible to overflow. The contract does not handle large numbers or perform type conversions that could introduce vulnerabilities. Therefore, the contract is secure against arithmetic attacks due to its use of Solidity's built-in overflow checks.
