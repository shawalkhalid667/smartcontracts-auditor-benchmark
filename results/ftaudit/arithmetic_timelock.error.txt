1. The contract uses block.timestamp (now) in the lockTime mapping which can be manipulated by miners (TIME_MANIPULATION). The withdraw function relies on the current time being past the lockTime, which can be exploited by miners adjusting the block timestamp (DENIAL_OF_SERVICE). The arithmetic operation in the increaseLockTime function could overflow if _secondsToIncrease is large enough to cause an overflow (ARITHMETIC). There is no access control mechanism preventing unauthorized access to critical functions (ACCESS_CONTROL). The use of msg.sender.transfer(transferValue) in the withdraw function could potentially lead to reentrancy if the recipient contract calls back into the TimeLock contract before the balance is set to zero (REENTANCY).
