=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses a gas limit check in line 16 which is intended to prevent denial of service attacks by resetting the creditorAddresses array when it reaches a certain size. However, this mechanism can be bypassed if the attacker controls enough nodes in the network, leading to potential denial of service. The function addCreditors() at line 18 adds 350 addresses to the array without checking the gas limit, exacerbating the issue if the attacker controls enough nodes. The use of msg.sender in addCreditors() could also be exploited if the attacker controls the nodes sending transactions to this contract. Access control is not implemented, allowing anyone to call these functions. The precision of the gas limit check could also be exploited if the attacker controls enough nodes to manipulate the gas limit.
