0. The contract does not use call.value(), nor does it have any functions that could lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities. There are no unchecked low-level calls present. The use of'require(unlocked)' ensures that certain functions cannot be called when the contract is locked, providing some access control. However, there is no evidence of time manipulation or bad randomness being used. The code is secure against denial of service attacks due to the use of 'unlocked'. Front-running is not possible as there are no functions that allow for the execution of arbitrary code before state changes are made. Arithmetic operations are not present in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities. Overall, the contract is secure against the target vulnerabilities based on the provided code.
