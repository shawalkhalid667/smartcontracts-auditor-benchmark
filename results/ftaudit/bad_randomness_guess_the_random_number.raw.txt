=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
1. The contract uses block.blockhash(block.number - 1) which is a low-level call that could potentially lead to vulnerabilities if not handled correctly. However, in this context, it is used to generate a random number based on the block hash and number, which is not inherently malicious but can be manipulated by miners. The use of now (block.timestamp) adds another layer of potential manipulation as it can be controlled by miners to some extent. Despite these manipulable inputs, the contract's logic does not introduce additional risks beyond those already present in the inputs. Therefore, while the use of low-level calls and time manipulation can be exploited, the specific implementation here does not introduce additional vulnerabilities beyond those inherent in the inputs.
