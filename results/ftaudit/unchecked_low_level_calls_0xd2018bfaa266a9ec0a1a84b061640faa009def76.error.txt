0. The contract uses call.value() in an unsafe manner in the Get() function, which is a known vulnerability. Specifically, line 17 where Owner.transfer(this.balance); and msg.sender.transfer(this.balance); are used without proper checks or reentrancy guards. This can allow an attacker to withdraw funds repeatedly if the balance is not properly updated before the transfer occurs. Additionally, the withdraw() function on line 22 has a access control issue as it attempts to set a new owner based on a specific address check, which is not secure. The Command() function on line 27 also requires scrutiny as it allows arbitrary calls to be made to external addresses, potentially leading to further vulnerabilities if the data parameter is manipulated.
