0. The contract uses call.value() in the WithdrawToHolder function which can lead to unchecked low-level calls. Specifically, line 97 contains the vulnerable code: '_addr.call.value(_wei);'. This external call happens before the state change (Holders[_addr]-=_wei), allowing for a potential reentrancy attack where an attacker could call back into the contract during the external call and drain funds repeatedly. Access control is implemented through the onlyOwner modifier, but it does not prevent reentrancy attacks once the external call is made.
