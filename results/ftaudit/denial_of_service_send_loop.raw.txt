=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.


=== USER ===
Return ONLY the JSON object described in the system message.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses send() which is equivalent to call.value(). This can potentially lead to denial of service if one of the recipients is a contract that reverts on failure instead of returning the funds. The loop in refundAll() iterates over all refundAddresses without checking if the send was successful before moving to the next address. This order of operations allows for the possibility that if one send fails, the entire loop will be stuck in that state until the transaction is mined or reverted. The lack of proper error handling or a check to ensure the send was successful before moving to the next address contributes to the vulnerability. Access control is not implemented, allowing anyone to call refundAll(). The use of require() does not prevent the loop from continuing if the send fails, it only logs the error.
