=== SYSTEM ===
You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.


=== USER ===
Return ONLY the JSON object described in the system message.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
1. The contract uses block.timestamp (now) in the lockTime mapping which can be manipulated by miners (TIME_MANIPULATION). The withdraw function relies on the current time being past the lockTime, which can be exploited by miners adjusting the block timestamp (DENIAL_OF_SERVICE). The arithmetic operation in the increaseLockTime function could overflow if _secondsToIncrease is large enough to cause an overflow (ARITHMETIC). There is no access control mechanism preventing unauthorized access to critical functions (ACCESS_CONTROL). The use of msg.sender.transfer(transferValue) in the withdraw function could potentially lead to reentrancy if the recipient contract calls back into the TimeLock contract before the balance is set to zero (REENTANCY).
