0. The contract uses block.blockhash(block.number-1) which is susceptible to manipulation by miners. This can affect the randomness of the secretNumber generation, leading to potential exploitation by miners who might manipulate the blockhash to increase their chances of winning. The use of sha3() for hashing also introduces vulnerabilities as it can be manipulated by miners to influence the outcome of the game. The time constraint in the kill() function could be exploited by miners who might manipulate the timestamp to trigger premature contract suicide. Access control is implemented through the ownerAddr variable, but it does not prevent manipulation of the environment variables by miners. The arithmetic operation in the shuffle() function could lead to vulnerabilities if the operation results in unexpected values due to overflow or underflow. Overall, the contract has several points where manipulation can occur, leading to potential exploitation by miners.
