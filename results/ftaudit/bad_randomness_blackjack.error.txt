1. The contract uses block.timestamp in the Deck.deal function which can be manipulated by miners (point a). This impacts the randomness of card dealing as the outcome of the deal function can be influenced by miner manipulation of block.timestamp (point b). The use of block.timestamp without proper safeguards against manipulation makes the contract vulnerable to attacks where miners could exploit the randomness for their benefit (point c). The precision of block.timestamp does not meet the requirements for secure random number generation as it can be controlled by miners (point d). Specific lines of concern are the use of block.timestamp in the Deck.deal function at line 17,19,21 where it is used to generate random numbers for card dealing.
