0. The contract uses low-level calls without checking the success of the transaction, which is a critical issue. Specifically, in the functions'sendToWinner' and 'withdrawLeftOver', the use of'send' (lines 20 and 27) does not handle the case where the recipient contract is malicious and reverts the transaction after receiving funds. This could allow a winner to call back into the contract and drain more funds before the state is updated to prevent further withdrawals. Additionally, there is no access control mechanism preventing unauthorized calls to these functions, exacerbating the risk of exploitation. The internal function implementation does not include safeguards against reentrant calls, making the contract vulnerable to attacks where an attacker could manipulate the state before the contract updates its state to prevent further withdrawals.
