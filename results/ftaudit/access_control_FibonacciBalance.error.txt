0. The contract uses delegatecall in a way that could potentially allow unauthorized access to critical functions. Specifically, in the FibonacciBalance contract, the withdraw() function uses delegatecall to call a function in the FibonacciLib contract (setFibonacci). This interaction occurs before transferring funds to the user. If the FibonacciLib contract is malicious or compromised, it could manipulate the calculatedFibNumber variable, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially allowing users to withdraw more funds than they should be entitled to. Additionally, the fallback function in FibonacciBalance allows any user to call delegatecall on the FibonacciLibrary contract, which could be exploited if the FibonacciLibrary contract is malicious or compromised. These issues relate to access control as they involve unauthorized external calls that can alter the contract's state before any checks are made.
