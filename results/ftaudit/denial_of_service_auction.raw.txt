You are a smart contract security auditor.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be exactly ONE valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE.
- The first character MUST be '{' and the last character MUST be '}'.
- Do NOT output prose, markdown, numbering, code fences, or extra commentary.

Task: Identify which SmartBugs vulnerability categories are present in the contract.

Allowed categories (use these exact strings):
unchecked_low_level_calls, time_manipulation, bad_randomness, denial_of_service, front_running,
access_control, short_addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, other

Output JSON schema (exact keys):
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "<one of the allowed categories>",
      "severity": <int 1..5>,
      "confidence": <int 1..3>,
      "title": "<short>",
      "rationale": "<1-3 sentences>"
    }
  ],
  "detected_categories": ["..."]
}

Rules:
- If you are not confident, omit the finding (prefer precision).
- If you find nothing, output {"findings": [], "detected_categories": []}.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.

=== MODEL_OUTPUT ===
0. The contract uses'send()' which is equivalent to call.value() and can potentially lead to denial of service if the recipient contract reverts. Specifically, line 9 contains the vulnerable code:'require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid));'. This operation is susceptible to denial of service because if the recipient contract reverts, the entire transaction will revert, allowing the bidder to win without having to pay the previous frontrunner. This vulnerability is related to unchecked low-level calls, time manipulation, bad randomness, denial of service, front-running, access control, short addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic, and other issues.
