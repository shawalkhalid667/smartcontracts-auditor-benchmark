0. The contract uses call.value() in the WithdrawToHolder function, which is a potential area for reentrancy attacks. Specifically, line 93, where the external call is made before updating the state variable Holder[_addr], allows for a malicious contract to potentially call back into the WithdrawToHolder function before the state is updated, leading to reentrancy. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of proper access control checks around the external call, as well as the order of operations placing the external call before the state update.
