0. The contract uses access control through the modifier onlyowner, which restricts the withdraw function to be called only by the owner. This is correct usage of access control mechanisms. There are no unchecked low-level calls, time manipulation, bad randomness, denial of service, front-running, short addresses, reentrancy, arithmetic vulnerabilities, or other issues present in the code. The constructor name is not incorrect as it does not use the constructor keyword, which is not used in Solidity versions prior to 0.5.0. Therefore, the code is secure against smart contract attacks.
