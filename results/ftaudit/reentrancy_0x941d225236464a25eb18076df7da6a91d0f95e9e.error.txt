0. The contract uses call.value() in the CashOut function, which is a known source of reentrancy vulnerabilities. Specifically, line 44 contains the vulnerable code: 'if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)())'. This external call happens before the balance is updated, allowing for a potential reentrancy attack where an attacker could withdraw funds repeatedly by calling CashOut again before the balance is deducted. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of proper access control mechanisms that could restrict who can call CashOut.
