0. The contract uses block.blockhash() in multiple instances which can be manipulated by miners, leading to potential vulnerabilities related to time manipulation and bad randomness. Specifically, in the function 'calcHashes', lines involving block.blockhash() are susceptible to manipulation as they rely on the blockhash of past blocks to generate a hash value. This can be exploited by miners who have control over the content of these blocks, affecting the outcome of bets and potentially leading to unfair advantages. Similarly, in 'getHash', the use of block.blockhash() can lead to discrepancies if the data in 'hash' is corrupted due to miner manipulation. The precision of time measurements used in critical operations such as determining when bets can be made or rewards can be claimed is also impacted by this reliance on block.blockhash(), which can be manipulated by miners to delay or expedite these processes.
