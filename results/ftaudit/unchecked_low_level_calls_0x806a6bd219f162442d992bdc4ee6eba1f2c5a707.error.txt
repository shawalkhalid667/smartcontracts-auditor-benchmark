0. The contract uses call.value() in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities. In the function GetPie(), line 17, the transfer of funds to the owner and the sender happens without proper checks or validation post the balance change. This order of operations could allow a malicious contract to withdraw funds before the balance is updated, leading to reentrancy. Additionally, in the withdraw() function, line 26, there is a lack of proper access control as it checks for a specific address instead of using the Owner variable, which could be exploited if the specific address is controlled by an attacker. The Command() function, line 30, allows arbitrary calls to be made to external contracts, which could be used to manipulate the contract's state or execute unauthorized operations.
